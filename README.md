To handle a redirect URL in JavaScript on the backend, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the URL to which you want to redirect the user. This could be a specific route or an external URL.

2. Create a server-side route that will handle the redirect request. This can be done using a framework like Express.js or any other backend framework.

3. In the backend route handler, use the appropriate method to perform the redirect. In Express.js, you can use the `res.redirect()` method to redirect the user.

4. Specify the appropriate HTTP status code for the redirect. The most common status code for redirects is `302 Found`, which indicates a temporary redirect. You can set the status code using the `res.status()` method.

5. Pass the redirect URL as an argument to the `res.redirect()` method. This can be an absolute URL or a relative path depending on your requirements.

6. Call the `res.redirect()` method to send the redirect response to the client. This will instruct the client's browser to redirect to the specified URL.

7. If needed, you can include additional logic before or after the redirect, such as processing data, validating user input, or setting cookies.

8. Ensure that the redirect is working as expected by accessing the relevant endpoint or triggering the redirect through your application. Verify that the user is redirected to the desired URL.

By above steps, you can handle redirect URLs on the backend using JavaScript, allowing you to control the flow of user navigation and provide a seamless user experience.

1. Create one .env file in the project directory and store **GITHUB_CLIENT_ID** and **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET** KEY.
